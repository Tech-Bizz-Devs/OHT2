# üìù Password Manager Application

## üöÄ Introduction

The Password Manager is a powerful yet simple Java application designed to help users securely store and manage their passwords. It provides basic password management functionality, including storing, searching, and deleting passwords, as well as adding and retrieving notes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Password Storage:** Users can store their account names and passwords securely using a Hashtable implementation.
- **Password Generator:** The application includes a password generator for creating strong and secure passwords.
- **Security Questions:** Users can set security questions and answers for added account security.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of Java programming.

### üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac PasswordManager.java
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java PasswordManager
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### Storing Passwords

1. Launch the Password Manager application.
2. Click on the "STORE PASSWORD" button.
3. Enter the account name and password.
4. Set a security question and answer.
5. Click the "STORE" button.

### Searching Passwords

1. Click on the "SEARCH PASSWORD" button.
2. Enter the account name for which you want to retrieve the password.
3. Answer the security question.
4. View the retrieved password.

### Deleting Passwords

1. Click on the "DELETE PASSWORD" button.
2. Enter the account name you want to delete.
3. Confirm the deletion.


## üîí Security Considerations

- This password manager does not implement encryption for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, encryption should be added to enhance security.
- Users should set strong passwords and security questions for better protection.
- Ensure that the machine running the application is secure to prevent unauthorized access.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## üìö Usage

- **Add Item Tab**: Enter the name, username, and password, then click the "Add" button to add credentials.
- **All Items Tab**: View all saved credentials. Double-click on a row to edit the credentials.
- **Remove Item Tab**: Enter the ID of the credential you want to remove, then click the "Remove" button.

## üí° How It Works

- The application uses Swing components to create a graphical user interface.
- Credentials are stored in an array of custom `Login` objects.
- The `DefaultTableModel` is used to display and manage data in the JTable.

To run the Java application provided, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

### Steps to Run:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` and `repository-name` with your GitHub username and the name of the repository, respectively.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Code:**
   ```bash
   javac NewJFrame.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java NewJFrame
   ```

5. **Interact with the Application:**
   Once the application starts running, you should see the Password Manager interface. You can interact with the different tabs to add, view, and remove login credentials.

6. **Close the Application:**
   Close the application window when you're finished using it.

### Additional Notes:

- Make sure to have a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) version installed on your system.
- If you encounter any errors during compilation or execution, double-check the steps and ensure that your environment is properly set up.
- If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can also import the project directly into the IDE and run it from there.

Following these steps should allow you to successfully compile and run the Java application provided. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
